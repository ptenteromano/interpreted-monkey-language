# monkey-interpreter

This is the interpreter for the Monkey programming language. It is based on the book <i>"Writing an Interpreter in Go"</i> by Thorsten Ball. Followed along and implemented myself.

Code structure and design is based on the book, but I have made some modifications and improvements to the code.

This book has helped me improve my understanding of interpreters, as well as improve my Go programming skills.

Build it with:
`go build -o bin/monkey-interpreter ./cmd/monkey-interpreter`

## Statements
Only two statements are supported:
- `let` statement
- `return` statement
